# tinyPulsePPG

This project implemented on an ATTiny85 displays a moving Photoplethysmogram together with pulse rate and estimates of SPO2 - blood oxygen percentage. Uses SSD1306 128x32 OLED display and a Max30102 sensor. It is emphasised that this should not be used for medical purposes. Computation of SPO2 is highly unreliable. The project is an exercise in software and hardware parsimony.
